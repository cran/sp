	  docs.

2010-12-12 21:52  edzer

	  spatial objects in
	  selections like points[polygon,] now also work for
	  Spatial*DataFrame as
	  selection criterion (taking the geometry of it); removed the
	  returnList=TRUE
	  option for those "over" methods that do not (yet) support it
	  (triggers error).
	  Changed vignette and tests accordingly.

	  with instances for each SpatialXxx.

2010-11-18 21:36  edzer

	* [r1001] removed the full matrix need in .invert

2010-11-15 22:53  edzer

	* [r999] modified some of the over and pointInPol functions to
	  catch the case
	  where more than one polygon coves a point (think package cshapes)

2010-11-13 19:43  edzer

	* [r998] forgot to add & commit the docs for the geometry method,
	  mentioned in the
	  previous commit.

2010-11-13 19:37  edzer

	* [r997] match.ID in SpatialXxxDataFrame() now can be character, in
	  which
	  case the corresponding column in the data.frame is used;
	  
	  A generic geometry() converts a SpatialXxxDataFrame into a
	  SpatialXxx.
	  
	  A generic over() provides a better overlay then overlay -- it is
	  consistent in that over(x,y) provides characteristics of y on
	  spatial
	  locations of x -- I didn't modify overlay() as too many instances
	  (including the book) rely on its inconsistency.
	  
	  Selection of objects can now be done by spatial objects: x[y]
	  returns the polygons x covered by points y, or the points x
	  inside
	  polygons y, etc.
	  
	  Related to this: x[x$dist < 30,] would work for
	  SpatialPixelsDataFrame but fail for SpatialGridDataFrame -- it
	  now works; any i-selector (first, with ,) longer than the number
	  of rows selects the cells. Selecting cells means essentially that
	  de-selected cells get assigned NA (!).
	  
	  a names methods for SpatialPolygons was added.

2010-11-08 21:26  edzer

	* [r996] reverted overlay changes back to 0.9-72 state.

2010-11-08 17:27  edzer

	* [r995] added a geometry generic and method, that returns the
	  coercion to
	  a Spatial* object from a Spatial*DataFrame object.

2010-11-08 12:56  edzer

	* [r994] docs pass check

2010-11-08 12:34  edzer

	* [r993] modified (corrected?) overlay methods; see post on
	  r-spatial-devel;
	  added selection with Spatial object to SpatialPolygons objects.

2010-11-06 10:40  edzer

	* [r992] extended "[" method for these classes to allow the first
	  argument that is
	  of class "Spatial"; in that case, the selection will be those
	  items that
	  do not result in an NA when overlaied with the object.
	  
	  for SpatialGridDataFrame, I now allow the first index to be of
	  length
	  nrow(x@data), meaning that cell-by-cell selection takes place
	  instead of
	  row-based.

2010-10-31 13:01  edzer

	* [r991] added ,drop=FALSE to as.image function, for the case of
	  single row or col grids

	  from the .q
	  sources in sp/S by typing `make' in the sp directory. This was
	  necessary to create a single S-Plus/R source. Removing them
	  hopefully
	  decreases the chances of changes to .R files, being overwritten.

	* [r99] further S-Plus portability issues, like grep(),
	  par("col")/par("fg")

2004-04-21 13:16  edzer

	* [r98] moved main sorce from R (R-code) to S (single code for R
	  and S-Plus);
	  this requires a single make in the sp directory to create the R
	  sources
	  from S. So, no longer modifying in the R directory; use the S
	  (*.q) code
	  instead!!
	  
	  `make' also creates .Rbuildignore, with all the files that an R
	  build
	  should ignore.
