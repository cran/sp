The legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning the sp package,
which was just  load ed, were retired in October 2023.
Please refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially

It may be desirable to make the sf package available;
package maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.
